# Numerical-Methods-with-Matlab-2017
I created this small projects for learn how to work Numerical Methods in Matlab.
I did this projects when i was in the second semester of the 2st grade at school in 2017.
I've developed projects about the topics that form the basis of Numerical Methods (Such as Newton Raphson, Jacobi etc.) in Matlab.
